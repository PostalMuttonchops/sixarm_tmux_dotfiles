Our `tmux.conf` dot file.

You can read the file to see what it does, and edit your own copy as you like.

Two important items for a beginner to know:

  * We change the tmux prefix key from "C-b" to "C-a".

  * We change the installation location from `~/.tmux.conf` to `~/config/tmux/tmux.conf`.

To install:

```
./install.sh
```
